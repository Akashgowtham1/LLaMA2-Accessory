## Introduction

We present $\color{goldenrod}{SPHINX}$, a versatile multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with a mixer of training tasks, data domains, and visual embeddings. 

- **Tasks Mix.** For all-purpose capabilities, we mix a variety of vision-language tasks for joint training, including VQA, REC, REG, OCR, etc. 

- **Domain Mix.** For data from different domain sources (real-world and synthetic), we mix the weights of independently trained specialized models.

- **Embedding Mix.** We capture robust visual representations by distinct visual architectures, pre-training paradigms, and information granularity.

Via our proposed three-fold mixer, $\color{goldenrod}{SPHINX}$ exhibits superior multi-modal understanding and reasoning powers.
