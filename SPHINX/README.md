## News
* **[2023-10-16]** We release the demo, code, and model of SPHINX ðŸŽ‰.

## Introduction

We present $\color{goldenrod}{SPHINX}$, a versatile multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with a mixer of training tasks, data domains, and visual embeddings. 

- **Task Mix.** For all-purpose capabilities, we mix a variety of vision-language tasks for joint training: VQA, REC, REG, OCR, etc.

- **Embedding Mix.** We capture robust visual representations by distinct visual architectures, pre-training, and granularity.

- **Domain Mix.** For data from real-world and synthetic domains, we mix the weights of independently trained specialized models.

Via our proposed three-fold mixer, $\color{goldenrod}{SPHINX}$ exhibits superior multi-modal understanding and reasoning powers.
